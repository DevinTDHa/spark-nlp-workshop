Background\nThe opposite use case is when you want to carry out Text Classification but only of certain pieces of the document. A good example of it it's Clauses Extraction or Clauses Identification in Legal Documents.\n\nThere are several ways we can carry out Text Classification:\n\n1) `At a whole-text level`: That's not feasible for most legal documents. As we already know, we have a 512 token estriction for most BERT-based thansformers. We can use Longformers or BigBird, but in most cases, Legal documents have many pages, what will go for sure beyond any limitation.\n\n2) `Using sentence-splitting`: That will definitely split the document at smaller chunks, but often times, the meaning will be contained inside a paragraph level (multisentence lever).\n\n3) `Using a multiline splitting`: We can create our own rules not not split by `\\n` or stopping characters like `.` but, for example, by headers, subheaders or even multiple lines."],"metadata":{"id":"UTbjKyhK1zcP","application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"25fc8f7a-0c71-4ec4-976b-6b57a5bf44c1"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text = \"\"\"Exhibit 10.2\n\nExecution Version\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGREEMENT\n\nThis INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGREEMENT (this \"Agreement\"), dated as of December 31, 2018 (the \"Effective Date\") is entered into by and between Armstrong Flooring, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Seller\") and AFI Licensing LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"Licensing\" and together with Seller, \"Arizona\") and AHF Holding, Inc.
