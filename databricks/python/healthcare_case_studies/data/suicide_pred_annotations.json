whats her past medical history? and maybe about 40 other questions.  even calling my cat a train wreck. she was in horrible condition and he kept telling me things such as \"well if you wouldve taken her to your regular vet and had checkups sooner, all of this couldve been prevented\" \"you should've given her her medicine. hyperthyroidism is manageable and bc you didnt do this and that your cat is in the condition that shes in\"   which just made me feel so damn guilty. i wanted to take her away right then and there. he then tells me that he couldnt feel her liver and that she only had 25% of her kidneys working and that she was extremely dehydrated.\n\nhe mentioned giving her medicine and iv drips and changing her diet but because of the state she was in, he said it wouldn't do much at all at this point because her kidneys would eventually fail. so then he suggests euthanasia. and my heart dropped like a rock. i didnt want to do it. i wanted to give her the medicine i was hell bent on it. ill pay it now, i dont care what the price is ill pay it now! but he kept pushing me and my sister to sign up for a credit plan to pay for it because he simply \"didnt want to be the bank\" he even said that we could give her all of the medicine and change her diet etc and theres a possibility that it still wont work at all because of how debilitated she was. \n\neventually our family made the decision to have her put to sleep on the same day as the visit. we had a previous cat who passed away due to kidney failure and we didnt want her to go through the same thing. we all snuggled her, kissed her and pet her until she breathed her final breath on the table. it was heart wrenching. we didnt want to bring her home because we all live with out 80 year old grandmother who prior to having her put to sleep, my grandmother would see her dragging her legs and see how weak and exhausted she looked and would start crying and saying how she didnt want to see the cat suffer like that anymore.  we didnt want to bring her home because we didnt want anything to happen to grandma so  we had everything done in one day and it all happened so fast. im still torn about it. i feel like i can go back in time and pull her away from the table, and bring her to present day. \n\ni miss you so much misty,  my little baby. it felt like we all yanked you out of this world too soon and thats what drives me crazy. the regular vet i tookher to long ago when we first found out about it told us all that she had hyperthyroidism. all 3 of us were in charge of making sure she got her medicine until she finished it, and then it dwindled down to just me having the responsibility. i was in a very stressed out mindset between my shit job with no set hours,  and  taking care of my grandmother who has dementia.we have to make sure she dosent wander outside or anything. and had completely forgotten/ was counting on other family members to give her her medicine because i was not home. i had forgotten that she even took  medicine at all because she was doing so well. she was eating, and playing until about last year when i went to have her ears checked. thats when they reminded me. and it all went downhill. \n\nso again i gave her her medicine and she  finished it. only to find out this year she would have to be put to sleep. i never intended to hurt you misty, i never wanted you to get so sick. every morning i cry my eyes out wishing you were here with me on my bed or licking my hand or even meowing that cute little \"hello\" meow you used to do. every day i think about the what ifs and the if onlys. i cant even smell or look at certain things anymore, i cant smile or be happy anymore without my baby. \ni bought a box cutter last week because i was seriously contemplating ending my own life because of the horrible guilt. i feel like i murdered that cat. i feel like i purposefully let her get sick and die . i felt like she didnt need to be euthanized. it was my responsibility to make sure you got your medicine and i fucked up so bad. i dont want to live anymore feeling like this. im so sorry my sweet baby kitty.   how can i help my grandmother if i failed to help you? i feel like im the only one in the world dealing with this situation. i  know im not, but i just want to fucking die. i hate existing. everyday i wake up im reminded that my cat is gone. my best friend, my baby is dead and i caused it and i want to throw up. i hate living i want to die and just not feel anything im so sorry misty im so sorry",

      "text": "Reasons Why (trigger warning: rape, self harm, sexual assault) - - chronic pain from tmj (i can’t even eat, eat mushy or liquid foods), can’t talk or sing much anymore, just lay in bed and sleep to escape pain \n\n- chronic sinus infections (i can’t breathe, always feel like i’m about to sneeze, eyes swollen shut half the day)\n\n- i try to be a kind person the best i can. i’ve never yelled at a stranger or friend or boyfriend. i’ve never cheated. i’m not clingy. i support everyone with everything they do, and i give people hundreds of chances to change. i make food for people. if someone has a problem, even a random person who hasn’t been the nicest, i will talk to them and try to give them solutions. i try to put out good karma into this world. i know i won’t be here much longer, so might as well make a positive impact. i try to not be stepped on either though. \n\n- chronic inflammation and skin conditions (acne, eczema, every pore on my leg is purple and inflamed, eyelids are always inflamed and crusty and often swollen completely shut, family thinks i exaggerate these symptoms and that i just naturally look swollen and red or whatever)\n\n- zero friends. not exaggerating. not one friend. never had a close friend before. i’ve had depression ever since i’m 10. i text some people occasionally but no one i’m close to who i can share my feelings or hang out with.\n\n- was raped. no one acknowledged, and when they did realize, told me to be more picky with my sexual partners. i couldn’t have been more picky. i was passed out.\n\n- not in school (even though i had a 4.2 gpa and 1550 sat). was homeschooled 10-12th grade high school. went to liberal arts college in another state has manic/psychotic episodes had to go back home. started community college but parents pulled me out during my depressive episode.\n\n- no trust in men. i can never have a normal relationship. besides being raped, i had men bombard me with videos of porn stars and detail why i wasn’t as hot as them, inspect me for flaws, take advantage of my past trauma as part of their kink, lie to me about being married, tell me that the only reason they like me is because i’m psycho or dumb, etc. i shouldn’t have been dating during this bad time. during my klonopin withdrawal period, i had a panic attack and a guy just drove away.\n\n- ocd thoughts nonstop. i’m scared of even thinking certain thoughts. i’m convinced certain thoughts or not having certainty thoughts will jinx my future. i’m scared i’m a sexual deviant (even though i have no libido and am a straight vanilla female with only 2 sexual partners ever 3 including rape). i’m convinced i’m becoming a hermaphrodite, or that i’m actually transgender. weird thoughts.\n\n- eating disorder. scared of being fat, also scared of being skinny. i just want to look ill. i don’t want to look like a girl that men fetishize. look small and thin and pedophiles will want to rape me. look curvy and i’ll be objectified. i can’t stop bingeing and purging. i was underweight then a guy was checking me out now i want to become fat.\n\n- mom harassed me for my nude photos. she imitated how i took the photos, this is what drove me to attempt suicide. she showed them to my dad and sister and now everyone thinks i’m a slut and my sister tells my cousin about how i sleep with many men on the first date. \n\n- blatant preferential treatment for my sister. she gets her laptop fixed, i don’t. she gets haircuts, i don’t. while i was getting a seizure from klonopin withdrawals, my mom was shopping for a custom coat for my sister for hours and when i told my mom what happened she said something like “oh that’s not nice.”\n\n- hundreds of people know my diagnosis and think i’m crazy. my sister had a fundraiser for mental illness to help her get into a good college and to make it more inspirational she shared my health information with many people who now treat me weird.\n\n- everyone outside our family like extended family and family friends also are super patronizing and treat me as this person you want to be cordial with but also not get close to and are super patronizing \n\ni need someone to talk to so badly. i’ve felt this way for so so so long. no one cares. i feel invisible. i swear i can tell aloud that i want to kill my self and no one would care. i wish someone could ask me if i’m ok. i’ve asked other people so many times if they’re ok can’t remember the last time i’ve been asked that. i’m so selfish i hate it",

      "text": "Feeling stuck living with manipulative parents - i’m having doubts about wanting to keep going. i just turned 25, i’m a girl from the us who is disabled (i have depression, bpd, anxiety, add and i have bad tremors as a result of these issues) and my parents treat me like i’m a little girl. i have not worked a proper job very much in my life and i’m a little immature for my age. \n\nbasically, where i am now, i feel mentally and physically unwell to work - the tremors go in and out and i collapse of exhaustion at least twice a month from them. my parents, my mum especially- are pressuring me to work, she gives me jobs i know i wouldn’t be able to handle and i apply to them to make her happy, though i never hear back. she is a social worker and when i say i’m too unwell to work she goes *”i’ve worked with people with down’s syndrome, who were severely disabled, they had jobs.”* or *”i worked with a schizophrenic woman once, that’s worse than what you have, and she held down a 9 to 5 job.”* and so fourth. i think i should be on disability but my mum sees that as “giving up” and says that they won’t accept me because i “haven’t showed signs of trying” ie my small work history - the majority of money i’ve made over the years is from my music, but that comes few and far between.\nbecause i don’t have a job, my mum makes it my “job” in the house to be the only person who ever cleans our cats’ litter box, and when my tremors are going this is bad because i can’t hold the bag straight and i get litter and cat droppings everywhere, but she’s so insistent on sticking it to me that i’m not working that this doesn’t matter. \ni have two girlfriends, my parents only know i’m dating one of them. one lives in canada, i have wanted to run away there but my mum said if i even tried to visit her she would get canadian police to come get me since i’m mentally unwell (my canadian girlfriend also struggles with that and my parents like her but says she’s a “basket case” and that i shouldn’t  date her) but i  kinda don’t have a passport anyway.\n\nmy other girlfriend lives in the midwest us and my mum says if i moved there i’d never contact the family ever again even though i told her i would, and that i would become ungrateful towards my girlfriend and get an “attitude” with her - my parents say i have a short temper but i’m quite mellow, it’s just that years of verbal abuse from my father - who to his credit is finally doing something about this - has gotten me very damaged.\n\n\nanyways, i like tried to stab myself in the stomach but was stopped and the knife was taken from me. i feel  stuck, and i really want to keep going but it’s getting really difficult. i don’t want to break my girlfriends’ hearts. i don’t know what to do anymore. i don’t know if i’m just unstable or if my parents are really mistreating me.",

(she has did, and one of her personalities is an agressive one who made me dissociate when she wanted me to kms). you can say she's a bad influence, but she's the only one still standing by me and the only one with the same kind of humor. she has help so the thing that happened last year won't happen again.\n\nanyway, i became a little happier, started enjoying going outside again. i made friends in a therian community cuz i figured back in august i was a therian too. (whatever your opinion is about 'therians', pls dont post them here cuz this isnt what the post is about)\n\nidk why, but i knew i was going into a depressed moment again, as i was irritated everyday and selfharming again.... so i landed in the depressed wave again. or should i say drowning? i don't enjoy anything, every food tastes boring. i can't sleep cuz i cry every damn night. i'm constantly thinking about kms. i'm even trying it, or sort of searching boundaries. taking pills but just enough to still stay alive. or standing on the edge of the bridge but not jump.\n\nwhat triggered my to write this post, was because i heard a cat of mine has cancer and he may not survive another week. the cat that shoved his fur in my face :') so i got a little distracted in a traumatising situation which happened 2/3 years ago. (can't talk about it now cuz ptsd flashbacks will kill me with this amount of emotions i have now) the cat that walks over my legs, jumps in my neck and demands attention when i'm crying on the floor in the middle of the night. he is like my esa (not official one) and i'm about to lose him. i can't go through this. i can't lose the last string of the rope that i'm holding on the edge of a ravine. i feel like kms at the moment. i don't wanna die. i wanna be of this pain.\n\nabout the mental hospital in march? 18 days until an apointment to talk about practical stuff. then i have to wait another week (i guess?) to finally be there and be save from myself.\n\nbut plz give me some strenght, some advice. i know i need to hold on these last weeks, but i can't. every minute of everyday is torture. i don't think i'll survive until then.",

One little thing could push me over the edge. - my bedroom and bathroom look like a hurricane struck them and i can’t even eat normally, if at all. i can barely move. that’s not an exaggeration, just doing simple tasks feels like agony. i haven’t self-harmed in almost a year, yet i feel like relapsing. i just want to give myself alcohol poisoning or jump off of a bridge over an interstate. i feel like a burden on my fiancé. i know he loves me and that he’s concerned but he has his own problems and i’m only adding to his. i don’t recognize myself anymore. i don’t know who the fuck i am. i dread the future. watching my boomer parents suffer from addiction, depression and loneliness and struggle to afford retirement doesn’t give me high hopes. i despise the fucking world. i want no part of any of this cruel, selfish, violent, disgusting place. i don’t have the energy to partake in this rat race just to survive. \n\nif you’ve read this far, thanks for taking the time. sometimes all someone needs is to vent and not hold back their real thoughts and feelings.",

      "text": "Maintaining Relationships with People - hello!\n\nfirst of all, i really appreciate that you are taking the time to read my post and whether you were able to provide me with advice or not, thank you!\n\ni feel like in order to give a better understanding of my situation, i need to talk about what i've gone through (i'm sorry that it end being a very long post)\n\nwhen i was a kid, i was pretty much normal and had my group of friends but i used to be very shy and faced a lot of verbal abuse at that time but kept quite and thought it was a normal and ok thing, it didn't affect me though very much because of that. however in middle school, i've experienced trauma that changed me forever and left a very deep scar on me emotionally that took me years to overcome because no one tried to help, those who see me went through it and those who i spoke to about it didn't try to help. for years i had trust issues and was paranoid most of the time, it was my first experience of feeling alone and that no one understands me, and slowly i started to drift away and shut myself out, i just wanted to be alone and because of that i started to lose friends but i didn't care at that time, i thought i was doing the right thing by avoiding as much social interaction as possible. i guess in a way i was trying to protect myself.\n\nthe years after that, i've tried to regain my social life back and make friends again, i tried everything that i can from trying to act as a happy and funny person cause no one wants to see the real me, my depressing and sad self who wants to make friends with such a person? and when it actually works out, i thought i was doing the right thing but it ends up making me more depressed cause it takes me a lot of effort to be \"that person\" and i really didn't felt like i'm making any deep connection with anyone so i was like screw it, i'll just be myself by which i mean that i will not try anything to be forcefully liked by others and i thought since i'm into so many things, i will probably find someone who is into one of these things and be friends with but that didn't work out either. i kinda became that extra friend in a group that her existence or not didn't make any difference or that friend who you come to when your other friends are not around or that person you hang out not because you enjoy their company but you just don't want to be sitting alone. that messed me up in my senior year of high school, i felt like shit and i spent most of the time during the break in the toilet cause i rather that than feeling like shit when i am with others. and just to be clear, they are not awful people and they didn't say anything bad to me, it's just i've been friends with them for so long and whether at that time when i was trying to be the funny and happy person or myself, either way, i never felt i belong or that anyone cared, i felt i was just someone they knew and sure why not they can call a \"friend\".\n\nin college though is where my struggle peaked, all those friendships that i made in high school are slowly disappearing everyone was moving on with their lives and i guess that means leaving unwanted relationships behind but regardless i did what i thought was right and did my part. i've reached out to them but it always ends up a one-sided relationship with everyone apparently and no one will reach out to me if i don't so i stopped. there was this one person i was close to during my school years and i tried to be the friend she can rely on in time of needs and depend on, i wanted to be always there for her but she never makes time for me but somehow she can with others so i tried to put \"our friendship\" to the test and just respond coldly to her messages just to see if she will ask what's wrong, i want her to notice that there was a problem and see if she gonna care about our friendship but she ends up unfollowing me in social media and blocked me out of her life that simply even though she perfectly knows me too well and knows that this is not my kind of behavior.\n\ni had no problem talking with strangers, i can open a conversation and interact with anyone easily so trying to get to know people in college was not difficult except i don't think anyone wanted to be my friend, i just remain their classmate. i end up making just one friend in college, we had a lot in common and i really believed it could work out but it took a lot of ignoring of her frustrating attitude which sometimes makes me wonder if she will bother to hold on to me if i ever show my frustration. at some point, i've gone through a deep depression that made me very suicidal and thought there was no future for me but i was trying to hold on to hope and as much i want to act tough and act like i can handle this i couldn't, i really just need someone to talk to and so far as you can see i had no one except this college friend and i didn't know how it will go but thought let's give it a try so i opened up to her and after when i was done, the conversation didn't last for 2 minutes and i was so crushed because sure maybe she was not the perfect person to open up to but at that time i didn't have any option and i just really needed someone in my life to talk to. i really thought i'm gonna do it on that day cause i really lost hope.\n\nas of now, it feels like i'm back at the starting point. i probably sound very awfully pathetic person or stupid to you. every time when i'm not able to maintain any relationship in my life, i asked myself what's wrong with me? what have i done wrong in my life? i realized after a while that i try to fix things so hard in my life that i end up breaking it or damaging it but i always thought i was doing the right thing and doing my part by reaching out or helping out but somehow it doesn't make things better. it always seems that i'm the one making the effort and if you didn't notice, throughout those stages of my life that i mentioned no one tried to be my friend or wanted to but i've always seemed to be the one who wants to be someone's friend. right now, i'm very much confused about what exactly i'm supposed to do. i just don't understand why i'm struggling so much to find somewhere i belong, i feel very much rejected no matter what i do. if i make an effort or not i end up alone either way. everyone in my life seems to give up on me and no one bothers to hold on to me. i just don't know if i'm supposed to give up and just accept the fact that maybe this is how things supposed to be in my life.\n\ni tried not to bore you guys with the details and complicate stuff, i hope my situation was made clear and it wasn't confusing. i just really need some advice cause i don't think i'm going to find a good one from my mind. one again, thank you for taking the time to read my post!",

      "text": "Stress and loneliness are dragging me down again - after 29 years of being a shut in, sometimes having social anxiety so bad that i couldn't step out my house or go near the windows, mental health so bad that i couldn't work or finish school, i decided to go back to school. i'm dependent on a longtime so and it makes me feel awful. there have been elements of abuse in the past and i dont think i can fully trust anyone, so i have to do this or die or get a high paying job without a degree or hurting my back(i have a terrible back and neurological problems) i'll be left with something like stripping, or just suicide.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nat this point, classes are getting more intense, i'm already behind in an online class that posted no deadlines, because i'm prioritizing a class in which i work around 30 hours/week to keep my quality high(i'm aiming for a's and this class is supposedly graded harshly-so far i have a's and 1 b on something i worked on for just 10 hours). anyway, so i am behind in my online classes now, trying to make time to catch up, but seems impossible.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nmy other in person class doesn't take as much time, i have a 4 hour studio and homework takes me maybe 1-5 hours usually. i have trouble managing time because i hardly see my so, so when we do see each other, we stay up late and just play games. we havent had any intimacy in about a month, and otherwise it's like a 1-2x/month thing. he doesn't help me with the chores unless i ask a bunch of times even though i made a chore chart for us both to look at,on the fridge, and gave myself more things. he keeps promising he'll do chores,shower,brush his teeth, just basic things, and he doesn't. he actually said he'd do all the chores when i went back to school(like i'd done for him) and not to worry. i worried, but i left things for a bit and realized i was correct in being concerned after the house started looking trashed. if i talk to him he changes the topic or recites some meme. he kisses me maybe twice a day and is otherwise glued to his phone watching youtube videos- he quit video games as they were time consuming but just switched to videos instead. he's so addicted to his phone that he got his by a bus last year, while i was passenger. he's usually on his phone while driving and there's nothing i can do. i dont drive because of my anxiety, and i dont have a working car. i am very stressed right now and feel totally alone. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\ni literally dont have time to see a therapist. i dont even have time to see my doctors for checkups. all i do is work, at school,homework,and at home. i am painfully shy and awkward and have no friends. i've joined a few clubs to make friends but it seems impossible; people try to befriend me it seems, and i just don't know how to interact.  i had an amazing conversation with another top performer in my class with the difficult work and anticipated becoming friends- she tries, but i dont know how to reciprocate and i can tell that i make things uncomfortable because i react as if we never started forming a friendship, if that makes sense. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nin my other class there is one kid who has tried to befriend me. he has autism and comes across pretty brash. i try to remind myself that he has a condition and to not take things personally, but sometimes i can't help it and i feel terrible and other times he is just too close and i feel awkward. i think he seems genuinely friendly and most of the time i dont mind him, but i guess i'm just under so much stress at this point that everything is getting to me. the whole class is also pretty distracting, which again, is usually bearable but the stress is wearing me out and there's 0 things i can do to relieve it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nyesterday i got a grade back from a quiz and just a friendly note to try to speak up more during critique(i'm a design student, so this is an art class). i made a mental note to make sure to speak up during critique last night, and then i panicked. first i panicked because i wanted to be done my painting beforehand- i hadn't planned properly and am always the slow one in everything, so i kept messing up and didn't finish in time. it seemed i was one of 2 others who hadn't finished so that made me feel a little better. critique came and the aforementioned kid stood next to me as he always does, uncomfortably close, and then in front of me and i couldn't see the paintings. panic increased and i didn't want to be rude so i didn't say anything. i planned for what shouldve been my painting for critique and was called out of order and further panicked. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\ni have a disorder that causes dissociation under stress and i have social anxiety. so when i panic, my mind goes blank. this happened a few days ago; my dog is unfortunately aggressive with 1 dog in my neighborhood. she is a strong dog and fortunately until this point, it had only been my bf who had experienced this. she lunged at the dog and i wasnt strong enough to pull her back, i panicked,mind went blank, and i just stood there. in my mind, the only thing i could think was like, the idea or feeling of alarm, but i couldn't speak or move. the neighbor didn't seem to mind and gave the dogs treats, but i felt so terrible. i don't know how to fix this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nduring the critique, my mind was blank and i didn't know what to say. i absorbed things others had said, but my mind flushed them out when i tried to speak. speaking and thinking at the same time is difficult for me. i guess i'm just stupid. i usually think for a long time before i speak, and i can think and write, but i dont know how to think+speak quickly or at once. i just felt like crying and couldn't wait to just pack up and start on my drawing assignment(until i realized i'd forgotten my most important supplies).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ni grew up with abusive parents. my dad was pretty absent, working a lot, but when he was home he was a complete ass. he would constantly provoke me. my older brother harshly picked on me. my mom did the most damage, somehow. i grew up thinking she was \"good cop\", she taught me to think that. she could do no wrong, she was perfect, she was always right. if she was upset with me, even if seemingly unreasonable, i did mental gymnastics with myself to justify it. example: i didn't intervene in her argument with my dad over finances which 6 year old me didn't understand? i'm a bad person who doesn't love mom. \nmoms in the bathroom the 8th time this week with razor blades? i'd be her psychiatrist and beg her to come out,reason with her why she should. eventually i realized i didn't have to say anything. eventually still, i realized that i could probably leave because she would just come out soon anyway. i did once, around 6 or 7 and i guess she talked and i didn't respond, so she came literally running after me, cornered me, and yelled down at me for not loving her.\n&amp;nbsp;\ni have an eating disorder? \ni'm \"evil\", i'm a \"dirty slut\" even though i'm not allowed out of the house- this must be because of how i look or something i've done- am i that person? mom says so, so i guess so. \n&amp;nbsp;\nas a young child, i was mostly raised by my grandparents nextdoor and would sleep over at their house often. i'd cry myself to sleep every night because i thought my mom was mad at me. every day, i'd be to blame for something. once, i even got blamed for my dad losing $100. i don't even know why. my mom yelled from up at our back door to down at the yard at me, with the neighborhood kids all outside, telling me i'd better bring the $100 back right now. so then my friends assumed i was a thief(cause a 9 y/o who can't drive and never goes anywhere has a reason for money is definitely wont get caught with random money at some point 🙄). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nat some point, around 9, i started self harming because i didn't understand what i had apparently done. i was upset for always being such an apparent major cause of my mother's pain- the person i did love most in the world no matter what she thought.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nmy parents destroyed my education as an ongoing argument for the funsies i guess. i planned to graduate at 15 or 16 and gtfo. i was physically bullied at school to the point of having my arms near broken every day. i begged to be homeschooled- my plan was to be able to focus on my schooling without bullies and graduate early to get away from my family. i was in 2nd grade my first year homeschooling and skipped up to grade 5 work in everything but math, which i got up to maybe grade 3 which was equivalent to my current grade in public school work. my parents would argue about public and homeschooling and switch me back and forth at least once a school semester. so i'd be in public school in august for a few months, then homeschooled. obviously this ruined my extra work i'd done and i became discouraged. in 7th grade, i began having a lot of trouble with math. my mom refused to help me, saying i had learning disability and just couldn't learn so to not do it(and then help my lovely, psychotic step sister instead). she'd do this to me at public school too, and i'd often go in humiliated having to explain that i couldn't finish my homework. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nat one point, i wasn't allowed outside(my grandparents had moved in) and due to that and all the stress, i embraced being reclusive. i told myself i wanted to be that way and whenever people would think it was odd, my mom would huff back at them before i could speak, saying that not everyone has to have friends.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nand now i'm this. looking back, i remember my dad telling me that my mom coddled me too much and kept me from other people, wanting me all to herself. at the time i thought it was ridiculous, but now i see he was right; she needed me to soothe her, to blame for everything, to be there in misery with her. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\ni got older, decided that i wanted to try being social, so i'd say yes to every single opportunity. every one. that was a terrible idea and i ended up being abused by a few predatory opportunists, which in turn caused me major anxiety, more than ever before, and i became more reclusive than ever before. i havent held a stable job in a while. havent had friends since that time, about 10 years ago. i've been with my so, who has been abusive off and on. things were great for a few years until we moved out a few years ago, and now they've been very off and on. for a few years again, things have been pretty good as far as that goes, but obviously not having time and not feeling effort from the other person feels shitty too. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\na couple years ago i found myself in a terrible situation with him and decided my options were prostitution, stripping, drugs, or suicide. i mass applied to jobs but when i'd receive a response, i was never qualified for anything but retail which i've had bad experiences with and it doesn't pay enough. i stopped eating, became an alcoholic with the little funds i had, and attempted suicide somewhere near 3 times a week on average for a few months straight. i almost succeeded once and then my bf unexpectedly came home early and i was sent to the hospital. things didn't get better when i got out, i threw away my antidepressants since my feelings felt inappropriate in relation to my thoughts and situation, and resumed weekly attempts. otherwise i'd just lie in bed and try not to get up for fear of killing myself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2017 and 2018 sucked. last year got a little better and by the end of the year i decided to go back to school. i decided rather abruptly and didn't have time to seek diagnosis for learning disabilities, which i think i obviously have. i have a diagnosis of anxiety disorders and recurrent major depressive disorder but i've assumed i wouldn't receive any accommodations for those because.. what can be done?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ninstead i've tried plowing through my feelings and intentionally making myself uncomfortable by joining clubs and going to campus in person, but i'm not adjusting as quickly as i'd hoped. and in the real world, i will have to talk, i will have to have social skills. no one cares about you in the real world. i'm old and have already exposed myself to that in the many job fields i've attempted, so i'm aware. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ni just feel like i'm a failure. and now i'm overloading myself and i dont want to back down, but idk how to deal with everything and get no help, and have nothing outside of school and working at home. i need a good balance, but i have literally no way of making that happen. i'm in a club that meets once a week, the paper which is 1x a month, and now a new club that no one showed up for, so i became club leader. this will force me into social situations, and i hope that i can do it. in my head i'm telling myself to just do it, so i try, and i talk, and garbage comes out. and i'm older than everyone else, so it's awkward. i'm not supposed to be so immature and stupid by social standards. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ni feel like i'm just not going to make it. i have straight a's but i feel like i don't deserve them. my art never looks good to me even after spending hours working. i need to make this work but i dont know how. i dont know how to change who i've been for 29 years, in an instant, but i desperately want to. i want to be different, i dont want to be who i am anymore. in the meantime, i'm trying to squeeze in time with my so and getting very little sleep. most of it is just time in the same room not even interacting or talking or anything and i feel really void of any affection and social interaction right now, as well as anything fun. i used to walk every day- it's something that lessens the frequency of nerve pain and i dont even have time for that. the weather has been shit anyway. i dont find gaming fun, i don't like to sit, but that's all i'm doing. i'm exhausted. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ni dont even know what i'm getting at anymore with this. i'm just frustrated with life. everything is dull,i'm over stressed,lonely, and i honestly just hate myself. everything about myself is awful, i really hate who i am. i became really sick in the first few weeks of school and have had bronchitis for about 3-4 weeks. it's getting better but i feel like that happening really fucked a lot up for me since i had no energy. i dont know how to manage everything or how to socialize. i feel like i should just kill myself but i dont know how to even do it properly in a way that wont be totally awful. i'm looking to get away from pain and if the last minutes of my life could at least be peaceful that would be, well, ideal. i really wish assisted suicide for chronically suicidal people was a thing sometimes.",

      "text": "I'm not sure were else to turn - i have nothing but negative thoughts all the time, i can remember when it started but it has gotten so bad i tend to cry myself to sleep if i even can sleep. i don't know who to talk to and don't really have anyone to talk to so i just want to dump everything here and maybe get some guidance before i do something to make the pain go away. i never see my parents due to my mom and step dad being too busy with work and running a business and my dad is probably somewhere rotting in arizona. my sister is deployed in the navy and the other ran away a few years ago and haven't heard from her, and my older brother is a drug addict that cut ties with us a long time ago. \n\ni don't want to message a suicide hotline out of fear they will send an ambulance or force me into a hospital forcing bills on me that i can not afford, and i have no one close to talk to about it. my situation is, growing up my parents both lived in different bad areas with little money. i was never smart or talented at anything besides having an over active imagination. i always had a learning issue both with paying attention and remembering information regardless of how hard i tried. didn't have a lot of friends and ended up dropping out of high school. about 3 years ago i went back and got my adult diploma with the hopes it would be enough to get me on my feet. i'm now almost 26 and just a few months ago after i saw someone about my mental health i found out i have add. so some things where answered there, but it didn't help much. \n\nthe small amount of friends that i have, have become aware of my increasing depressed emotions and have tried to help but for the most part, they seem to pay no mind to it. i've working dead end jobs for most of my adult life until recently when i took a boot camp course in the information technology field. i then interned for 5 weeks and after got a position working for a small company as an it help desk technician under a 3 month to perm contract. or that's what they told me during the interview. i never did anything it related and the contract was constantly extend by 3 months until my 9th month there. in that time, i've worked for some bad companies, but i have never worked somewhere that treated there (specifically the us employees) so poorly. they then after promising to increase my pay hired me on full time as salary, and cut my pay thinking i wouldn't notice. i then secretly started looking for new positions starting last july until november of last year when i was tired of they way they have treated me for over a year and without thinking, just left, even though i have monthly bills. \n\non top of the learning problems, i also have extreme anger problems and am very very impatient. as far as work goes, i have applied to countless it positions since last july, with professional help updating resumes and cover letters, and re learning (trying to) as much it knowledge as i can after using pretty much none of it at my last job and forgetting almost all of it, but i've gotten nothing. i have had 2 companies interview me and reject me after the 2nd or 3rd interview, and all of the other countless companies i've applied to have either flat out rejected me or have not said anything. i have next to nothing left with money and if i don't find something soon, i will lose everything and i can only imagine how bad my credit will be and the law suits to follow. other than job things, i have never been in a real relationship, i never see my family even though i literally live with my mom and step dad, i almost never see my friends, i have an extreme hate for people i'm assuming due to everything i've had to go through over the years, and every day i spend hours trying to teach myself new things and applying for any position available that could possible help me with my situation, but since the last interview rejection and the constant no reply and email rejections, i can't anymore. \n\ni've tried so hard to make things better for myself, seeking medical help, close support from family and friends, and will power, but it's always one step forward and then being launched back. i'm tired of starting over, i'm tired of only knowing rejection and being ignored not just from jobs but from everything. i have become so angry and hate filled that i can't see happiness in anything. i used to love movies and video games and can't find joy in those. the only piece of escape i have day to day is music, because it almost thinks for me. i'm listening to it but i feel like it's also listening to me, feeling my constant pain and emotional wreck. everyone says it will get better, but i've been at this for so long and it only keeps getting worse. i have put the effort in but it's like some deity is purposefully trying to prevent me from being happy or making myself successful, and over the past few weeks, i can't stop thinking of killing myself. making this awful pain go away and not feeling anything anymore. the only thing that holds me back is the thought of what comes after. possible non existence which i can't even comprehend. just not knowing is the only thing holding me back, but even that fear is starting to go away and taking an early exit seems more and more like the best option.\n\ni apologize for the extremely long post, maybe just a way to leave a small mark on existence to make myself feel a little better. i don't seem myself feeling any better even if my hard work eventually gets me anywhere, a family, a job that actually pays enough for me to live on my own, not constantly worrying if i have enough for food and water or if i have to cut that out to make my payments. it's hard to feel happy or accomplished when all you know is failure and loss. there is more but i feel like i've said enough if anyone even reads this. i've re read this and gone over it a few times and i just keep feeling worse and adding more to it. thank you to whoever takes the time to read this",
