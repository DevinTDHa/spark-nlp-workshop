Its goal is to classify the assertions made on given medical concepts as being present, absent, or possible in the patient, conditionally present in the patient under certain circumstances,\n","hypothetically present in the patient at some future point, and\n","mentioned in the patient report but associated with someoneelse.\n","In the proposed implementation, input units depend on the\n","target tokens (a named entity) and the neighboring words that\n","are explicitly encoded as a sequence using word embeddings.\n","Similar to paper mentioned above,  it is observed that that 95% of the scope tokens (neighboring words) fall in a window of 9 tokens to the left and 15\n","to the right of the target tokens in the same dataset. Therefore, the same window size was implemented and it following parameters were used: learning\n","rate 0.0012, dropout 0.05, batch size 64 and a maximum sentence length 250. The model has been implemented within\n","Spark NLP as an annotator called AssertionDLModel.

The window is in format `[X,Y]` being `X` the number of tokens to consider on the left of the chunk, and `Y` the max number of tokens to consider on the right. Letâs take a look at what different windows mean:\n","\n","\n","*   By default, the window is `[-1,-1]` which means that the Assertion Status will look at all of the tokens in the sentence/document (up to a maximum of tokens set in `setMaxSentLen()` ).\n","*   `[0,0]` means âdonât pay attention to any token except the ner_chunkâ, what basically is not considering any context for the Assertion resolution.\n","*   `[9,15]` is what empirically seems to be the best baseline, meaning that we look up to 9 tokens on the left and 15 on the right of the ner chunk to understand the context and resolve the status.\n","\n","\n","Check this [Scope Window Tuning Assertion Status Detection notebook](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings_JSL/Healthcare/2.1.Scope_window_tuning_assertion_status_detection.ipynb)  that illustrates the effect of the different windows and how to properly fine-tune your AssertionDLModels to get the best of them.\n","\n","In our case, the best Scope Window is around
