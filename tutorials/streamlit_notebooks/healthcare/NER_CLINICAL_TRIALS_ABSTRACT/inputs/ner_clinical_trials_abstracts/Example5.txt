Intraocular pressure - lowering efficacy of brinzolamide when added to travoprost / timolol fixed combination as adjunctive therapy .PURPOSE : To compare the efficacy of brinzolamide versus placebo when added to travoprost / timolol fixed combination ( TTFC ) in uncontrolled patients . This was a prospective , double - masked , randomized , placebo - controlled , parallel comparison of ocular hypertensive or primary open - angle glaucoma patients . Patients treated with a adjunctive therapy were changed to TTFC qam ( every day dosing ) for 4 weeks .Patients were then randomized to either placebo or brinzolamide given twice daily in addition to TTFC . At week 12 , patients had their IOP measurements repeated .This study suggests that brinzolamide may be safely added to TTFC therapy to provide further significant reduction in IOP patients with ocular hypertensive or primary open - angle glaucoma
