A randomised crossover study comparing bimatoprost and latanoprost in subjects with primary angle closure glaucoma . This was an observer - masked randomised crossover study of 60 PACG subjects who received either latanoprost or bimatoprost for 6 weeks , after which they were crossed over to the other medication for another 6 weeks . CONCLUSIONS : Bimatoprost once daily was similarly effective in reducing IOP compared with latanoprost once daily in subjects with chronic PACG . Both drugs were well tolerated with mild ocular adverse events
